# Beginner's guide to Guitar 

Hi, this is my beginner's guide to guitar website. I will provide information on basic chords, theory and general guitar information, all for free. We will start by looking at the basics. The first section will include. A few of my beginner reccomendations for a first electric or acoustic guitar, and a few bits and bobs you will need to start learning.

## What guitar to buy?

Ideally, you would go to a guitar shop. Try a few different guitars depending on what genres you like and be set from there. However, some people are not able to do that so I will provide a few good options with links to them. 

### Squier and Epiphone

Epiphone and Squier are both legally licensed brands of the Gibson and Fender brands, respectively. They produce cheaper guitars often manafactured in Asia rather than the U.S. They are affordable and good beginner guitars. Please have a look at these two options a [Squier Stratocaster](https://www.guitarguitar.co.uk/product/180629329160008--squier-pack-strat-black) and an [Epiphone Les Paul](https://www.guitarguitar.co.uk/product/160330296435002--epiphone-les-paul-special-ve-vintage-worn-ebony).

#### Tabs

The first thing we will need to learn is how to read a tab. we will use these tabs to learn the first open chord positions so pay attention. The 6 strings on a guitar from top to bottomn are EADGBE. These will be represented in the tab. Black inlays accompanied by numbers will show you where to put your fingers and waht fingers to use. I will provide some examples [here](https://www.guitarlessons.com/guitar-lessons/guitar-theory-ear-training-and-reading/how-to-read-guitar-tabs).

##### Open Chords

Open chords are the most basic chord voicing of the notes E,A,D,G and C. The E chord is played using this [tab](https://www.justinguitar.com/guitar-lessons/the-e-chord-bc-113).
The A chord is played using this [tab](https://www.justinguitar.com/guitar-lessons/the-a-chord-bc-112). The D chord is played using this [tab](https://www.justinguitar.com/guitar-lessons/the-d-chord-bc-111). The G chord is played using this [tab](https://www.justinguitar.com/guitar-lessons/the-g-chord-bc-131) and finally, the C chord is played using this [tab](https://www.justinguitar.com/guitar-lessons/the-c-chord-bc-132).**These chords should be played fluently and being able to change between chords is required before moving on.You should also be able to name such chords.**

###### What next?

So you have mastered the first few open chords and are struggling with what to do now. Look no further. Now you should begin to learn the names of the frets on the guitars and notes they correspond to. You should also go onto Youtube  and find songs and riffs that you like and try and improve dexterity in your fingers. I will link two great Youtube teachers including [Marty Music](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmnlTWVJysjWPFiZhQ5uudg) and [GuitarLessons365](https://www.youtube.com/user/GuitarLessons365)
